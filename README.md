## About project
Simple chat.
The API supports registering, retrieving all users and communicating with them. Get real-time updates via log polling. Documentation for the REST API is provided.
I made a docker compose, this should make the program work universally

API documentation path: `{host}/api/v1/docs`

Build:
```sh
sudo docker-compose up --build
```


## :warning: Important information. :warning:
Right now I don't have a WEB CLI for the API. But I made a lightweight pythonCLI which you can try out.
